Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

MongoDB: Download and install MongoDB
Follow the instructions for your operating system to install and configure MongoDB.
Ensure MongoDB is running on localhost:27017 (or the configured host/port in your project).

Docker: Download and install Docker
Docker Compose comes bundled with Docker Desktop on most platforms.

Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Step 2: Configure MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is up and running. If you have custom MongoDB credentials or connection settings, update the application's configuration file accordingly (e.g., .env, config.js, or similar).

Step 3: Start the Application with Docker Compose
Use Docker Compose to build and run the application:

bash
Copy code
docker compose up -d
The -d flag runs the containers in detached mode.
This will spin up all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
Step 4: Verify the Application
Once the containers are running, you can access the application at:

plaintext
Copy code
http://localhost:YOUR_PORT
Replace YOUR_PORT with the port defined in your docker-compose.yml.

Additional Commands
View logs:

bash
Copy code
docker compose logs
Stop the application:

bash
Copy code
docker compose down
Rebuild the containers (if you've made changes to the Dockerfile):

bash
Copy code
docker compose up --build
Project Structure
plaintext
Copy code

├── Dockerfile # Application Dockerfile

Troubleshooting
Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.
If docker compose up fails, check for errors in the terminal and resolve any missing dependencies.
Check the logs with docker compose logs for detailed error messages.
